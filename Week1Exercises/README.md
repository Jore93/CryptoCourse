# Week 1 Exercises

This weekâ€™s exercises focus on classical ciphers and randomness.

Theory of the exercises are based mainly on the book [Serious Cryptography](https://nostarch.com/seriouscrypto)

Pages 1-38 are relevant for this exercise and might good to read beforehand.

Task #|Grade|Description|
-----|:---:|-----------|
Task 1 | 2 | Fooling a perfect cipher
Task 2 | 3-4 | Generating randomness and testing randomness
Task 3 | 5 | Vigenere cipher


## Task 1: Fooling a perfect cipher

Recall that the one-time pad provides perfect secrecy i.e., there is nothing an adversary can learn from the cipher text even given unlimited computational resources. 

However, the perfect cipher provides no other guarantees and does not provide authentication.

You are given the following encryption of an ASCII encoded message "Hi Kimmo". Each row in the table represents one character in binary and hexadecimal format.

Binary | Hex
--|--
0b01101001 | 0x69
0b00010101 | 0x15
0b01011111 | 0x5F
0b01001110 | 0x4E
0b00100000 | 0x20
0b00011100 | 0x1C
0b10101101 | 0xAD
0b01100001 | 0x61

### Task 1.1 

Produce a ciphertext that will decode into "No Rauli" under the same secret one-time pad as the original ciphertext was produced.

### Task 1.2

Produce a ciphertext that will decode into a 7 character ASCII string of your choice.

### Task 1.3

What is the secret one-time pad in binary?
