# Week 1 Exercises

This weekâ€™s exercises focus on classical ciphers and randomness.

Theory of the exercises are based mainly on the book [Serious Cryptography](https://nostarch.com/seriouscrypto)

Pages *1-38* are relevant for this exercise and might good to read beforehand.

## Environment

You should have access into Linux/Unix environment to be able to complete Task 3.

The course virtual machine is suitable.

## Grading

You are eligible for following points from the exercise. Previous task(s) should be completed before going further.

Task #|Grade|Description|
-----|:---:|-----------|
Task 1 | 2 | Fooling a perfect cipher
Task 2 | 3 | Vigenere cipher
Task 3 | 4-5 | Generating randomness and testing randomness


## Task 1: Fooling a perfect cipher

Recall that the one-time pad provides perfect secrecy i.e., there is nothing an adversary can learn from the cipher text even given unlimited computational resources. 

However, the perfect cipher provides no other guarantees and does not provide authentication.

You are given the following encryption of an ASCII encoded message "Hi Kimmo". Each row in the table represents one character in binary and hexadecimal format. This task expects that original form of the one-time pad has been used with bitwise exclusive OR.

Binary | Hex
--|--
0b01101001 | 0x69
0b00010101 | 0x15
0b01011111 | 0x5F
0b01001110 | 0x4E
0b00100000 | 0x20
0b00011100 | 0x1C
0b10101101 | 0xAD
0b01100001 | 0x61


**Task 1.1** Produce a ciphertext that will decode into "No Rauli" under the same secret one-time pad as the original ciphertext was produced.

**Task 1.2** Produce a ciphertext that will decode into a 8 character ASCII string of your choice. Can you produce longer ciphertexts than 8 characters? Why/why not?

**Task 1.3** What is the secret one-time pad in binary format?

> You should return possible source code for how you solved the secret and produced the new ciphertexts. Answer the questions and **also** explain shortly the idea of of your method.

You can verify that your key is correct, by combining single hexadecimal string from binary values, and calculating sha256 hash for them, for example

```shell
 echo "0xfffffffffffff" | sha256sum
```

Correct hash is `c6152a61293092b308ef1a818309b692372b51a5360d44431ffdcb75c8ab0349`

## Task 2: Vigenere cipher

The following text is an English text that has been encrypted by using an unknown key with a Vigenere cipher. All punctuation and whitespaces have been removed from the text before encryption.

**Task 2.1** Decrypt the text. What is the secret key? How many permutations were used?

**Task 2.2** Where is the text from? Who wrote it? If you find the source, read the whole text/article/newsitem/book...


> Show your work (code and reasoning; how did you decrypt this?) and answer the questions. You should not use existing tools which can solve this quite quickly. However, if you did, mention these tools, used commands **and** make step-by-step report **why Vigenere cipher was decryptable**. 

## Task 3: Generating randomness

Generate randomness to different files using different tools that you have access to or manually. Analyse those files with [dieharder](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dieharder) . Report your findings.
