# Week 3 Exercises

This weekâ€™s exercises focus on block ciphers.

*Pages 53-75* from the course book could be helpful for this exercise. It is available in the library of the University of Oulu in [digital format](https://oula.finna.fi/Record/oy_electronic_oy.9917612964306252).

## Environment

You should have access into Linux/Unix environment to be able to complete the final task.

The course virtual machine is suitable.

## Grading

You are eligible for following points from the exercise. Previous task(s) should be completed before going further.

Task #|Grade|Description|
-----|:---:|-----------|
Task 1 | 2 | Modes of operation
Task 2 | 3 | Wrong model type of attack
Task 3 | 4 | Forged cipher
Task 4 | 5 | Padding oracle

## Task 1 Modes of operation

Pick a programming language and a crypto library that supports AES.

Take a short message with two identical message blocks (e.g. all zeroes).

Encrypt this message using three different modes of operation ECB, CBC and CTR. Compare the encryptions of the first and second message blocks.

## Task 2 Wrong model type of attack


## Task 3 Forged cipher
