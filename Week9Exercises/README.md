## Task 1: Feedback on the course ##
Now in the final week we'd like to get your feedback on the course. Please answer the questions below. **Note that you can give also anonymous feedback through the Moodle platform in the Feedback section**

> Answer the questions above. Reference any outside sources that you have used.

## Task 2:  ##
Go to https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/files/new. Try out some quantum circuits (jost fool around, attach a screenshot of your most artistic one. Make sure that the different probabilities are shown in the picture.) Explain shortly what the circuit does (to the best of your understanding). b) Go to the “Composer docs & tutorials” (left hand panel, lowest option) and find the model for Grover’s algorithm. Modify the given circuit in such a way that the circuit will find the other alternatives (the example finds 00, you should find 10, 01 and 11). Explain how you modified the circuit.
