# Week 9 Exercises

This week’s exercises focus on quantum computing, post-quantum cryptography and feedback on the course.

## Grading

You are eligible for following points from the exercise. Previous task(s) should be completed before going further.

Task #|Grade|Description|
-----|:---:|-----------|
Task 1 | 2 | Feedback on the course
Task 2 | 3 | Quantum circuits and algorithms
Task 3.1 & 3.2 | 4 | Post-quantum Cryptography
Task 3.3 | 5 | Post-quantum Cryptography

## Task 1: Feedback on the course ##
Now in the final week we'd like to get your feedback on the course. Please answer the questions below. **Note that you can give also anonymous feedback through the Moodle platform in the Feedback section.**

* What did you like about the lectures?
* What would you improve on the lectures?
* What was missing from the course (i.e. what more would you have wanted from the course)?
* What did you like about the exercises?
* How would you improve the exercises?
* Did you miss some type of an exercise or some content as an exercise?
* Freeform feedback on the course

> Answer the questions above.

## Task 2: Quantum circuits and algorithms ##
In this task you wil try out some quantum computing yourself. Go to [the IBM quantum computer simulator](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/files/new). 

**2.1** Try out some quantum circuits (just fool around, attach a screenshot of your most artistic one. Make sure that the different probabilities are shown in the picture.) Explain shortly what the circuit does (to the best of your understanding). 

**2.2** Go to the “Composer docs & tutorials” (left hand panel, lowest option) and find the model for Grover’s algorithm. Modify the given circuit in such a way that the circuit will find the other alternatives (the example finds 00, you should find 10, 01 and 11). Explain how you modified the circuit.

> Answer the questions above. Reference any outside sources that you have used.

## Task 3: Post-quantum Cryptography ##
In this task you will learn more about post-quantum cryptography. 
Go to the [NIST PQC website](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography) and look at the finalists of the PQC standardisation (Round 3 candidates, not alternate candidates). 
**3.1** Answer the following questions:
* What hard problems are the candidates based on?
* What security levels are the candidates aiming for? (NIST has specified [five](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/documents/call-for-proposals-final-dec-2016.pdf) pages 16-17)
* What parameters sizes do the candidates have? Key size, signature size, key generation time, signature generation time, verification time etc?
**3.2** Look for any implementations of the finalists e.g. via Google. What systems/libraries/applications support these? Can you find a rationale for the decision to support a specific method?
**3.3** Pick a finalist candidate. Do a search on [Google Scholar](scholar.google.com) with the candidate name and some additional suitable search terms (e.g. 'post-quantum cryptography'). How many results can you find? Are there any attacks on or weaknessess in the proposed scheme? If there are, explain these very briefly.
