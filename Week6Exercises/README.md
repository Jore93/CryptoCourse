## Task 1: RSA encryption and signatures with OpenSSL ##

In this task you need to encrypt and sign a message with RSA. The [OpenSSL Cookbook](https://www.feistyduck.com/library/openssl-cookbook/online/ch-openssl.html) may be helpful in this task. You can also find more concise presentations  on who to do this on the command line with the help of your favorite search engine.

**1.1** Generate an RSA key of suitable length OR use one that you have previously generated. Generate a message and encrypt it using the public key.
> Provide the key and the message as your answer. Also show the commands that you used to encrypt

**1.2** Use RSA to sign the message. 
> Provide the public key, the message and the signature as your answer. Also show the commands you used to
